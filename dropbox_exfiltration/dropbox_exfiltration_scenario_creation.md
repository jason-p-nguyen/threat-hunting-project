# Threat Event (Dropbox Data Exfiltration)

**Large Sensitive File Uploaded to Unauthorized Cloud Storage (Dropbox)**

---
## Pre-steps: 

1. **Created a fake corporate user** (John Doe) to simulate insider behavior

   * Username: `j.doe` (standard user)
   * Did not switch users due to VM limitations; actions taken under `jnguyen.admin`

2. **Created sensitive files to simulate high-value data:**

   * `Employee_Record_Dump.csv`
   * `Quarterly_Financial_Projections_Q3.docx`
   * `Client_Credentials_Access.xlsx`
   * Files stored in `Documents\Confidential`
   * Metadata timestamps backdated using PowerShell

3. **Registered a personal email and Dropbox account:**

   * Email: `johndoe197541@proton.me`
   * Dropbox account created with same address

## Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Create Logs and IoCs:

4. **Downloaded and installed Dropbox silently:**

   ```powershell
   Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Users\jnguyen.admin\Downloads\DropboxInstaller.exe" -ArgumentList "/S" -Wait
   ```

5. **Logged into the Dropbox desktop app using John Doeâ€™s personal account**

6. **Uploaded sensitive files:**

   * Dragged into Dropbox sync folder
   * Manually uploaded via browser at `https://dropbox.com`

7. **Attempted cleanup:**

   * Cleared browser file upload history
   * Removed files from recent files list
   * Ran PowerShell script to silently uninstall Dropbox and delete associated files and folders

## Additional Notes:

* Dropbox is not inherently malicious but is often **unauthorized in corporate environments** due to data loss risks.
* This scenario highlights **insider threat behavior**, **shadow IT usage**, and **exfiltration via trusted services**.
* Consider pairing this hunt with:

  * Proxy logs
  * CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) alerts
  * DLP (Data Loss Prevention) detections
